# Caesar Cipher GUI Based Application

## Introduction:

This application is a desktop tool designed to encrypt and decrypt messages using the classic Caesar Cipher technique, all within a user-friendly graphical interface built with PyQt5. This project is built using PyQt5. This is a powerful Python binding for the Qt framework, enabling developers to create highly interactive and visually appealing desktop applications. Whether you're building a simple utility or a complex enterprise application, PyQt5 provides all the tools you need to design intuitive graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with ease. This application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption. 

## Features:

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application features a clean and intuitive layout, making it accessible to users of all skill levels.
- **Encryption and Decryption**: Easily switch between encrypting and decrypting messages by selecting the desired mode.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that users provide valid inputs, such as non-empty messages and numeric shift values, enhancing reliability and user experience.
- **Clipboard Integration**: A convenient "Copy" button allows users to copy the resulting encrypted or decrypted text directly to the clipboard for use in other applications.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Enjoy consistent performance and appearance across different operating systems.
  
## Requirements:

To run this application, you need the following:

- **Python 3.x**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
- **PyQt5**: This is the Python module used to create the GUI. You can install it using pip:

  ```bash
   pip install PyQt5
